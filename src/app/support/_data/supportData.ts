This is usually done by including a link that will appear to take you to the company's website to fill in your information â€“ but the website is a clever fake and the information you enter goes straight to the scammers behind the phishing attempt."

Look for red flags such as poor spelling or grammar, threatening language, or requests for immediate action. Always verify the sender's email address and hover over links before clicking to see the actual URL."

Do not click any links in the email. Instead, log in to your Cryptoniq account directly through the official website or app and check your recent account activity. If you notice any suspicious activity, change your password immediately and contact Cryptoniq support."
